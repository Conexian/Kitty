# KittyConsole

KittyConsole is a simple console-based application written in C#. It's a learning project aimed at improving C# skills and experimenting with various console commands. While not intended to be particularly useful, the source code might serve as a helpful reference for others.

## Features & Commands
KittyConsole includes several basic commands:

- `help` - Displays a list of available commands.
- `clear` - Clears the console screen.
- `ping` - Pings a specified address.
- `beep` - Emits a system beep sound.
- `meow` - Prints a message.
- `readfile` - Reads and displays the contents of a specified build embedded file.
- `sysinfo` - Provides basic system information.
- `portscan` - Performs a port scan on a given IP address.

## Usage
1. Download the source code from the repository.
2. Open `KittyConsole.sln` in Visual Studio.
3. Build and run the project.

## Development & Updates
This project will receive frequent updates until I completely run out of ideas. Feel free to contribute or suggest new features!
